      <h3>What is this site about?</h3>
      <p>This site is about the lives of ex-Presidents of the United States.</p>

      <h3>But <em>why</em>?</h3>
      <p>
        The first death of a president that I can remember was Lyndon Johnson's. In retrospect,
        it seems odd that I wasn't aware of Truman dying only a few weeks earlier, but I was young and
        I did not regularly watch the news. When I saw the reports of Johnson's funeral, I didn't
        know who he was. When I asked about it, I was told he had been the president before Nixon.
        The idea that there could be a living ex-president intrigued me. I knew that Nixon was the current
        president, and I knew about other presidents who were long dead, but it had never occured to me that
        there could be a living person who had been president. However, at the point in time when I came to that realization, there was no longer any living ex-president.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time, I wondered if it was unusual for there to be no living ex-president. As if in
        answer to that question, the number of living ex-presidents steadily increased as I grew older, and
        I started to wonder if there had ever been as many living ex-presidents.
        I also remember being fascinated when I learned that John Quincy Adams served in congress
        after being president. What other notable things did ex-presidents do?
      </p>
      <p>
        I built this site in order to explore and answer my childhood questions about ex-presidents.
        I now know that I experienced one of the few times in history when there were no living ex-presidents,
        and I then watched that number grow to five, a number reached only once before, and never exceeded.

      <h3>What is an exPOTUS?</h3>
      <p>
        An exPOTUS is a living ex-President of the United States. This site limits the definition
        to <em>living</em> ex-presidents, because it is about the
        <em>lives</em> of ex-presidents. It follows, then, that a president who dies
        while in office is never an exPOTUS. A president becomes an exPOTUS upon leaving office,
        and ceases to be an exPOTUS upon death.
      </p>

      <h3>What happens if an exPOTUS becomes president again?</h3>
      <p>An exPOTUS who becomes president again ceases to be an exPOTUS while in office.</p>

      <h3>What happens if two exPOTUSes die on the same day?</h3>
      <p>It complicates the data model and supporting logic.</p>
