    <h1 id="what-is-this-site-about">What is this site about?</h1>
<p>This site is about the lives of ex-Presidents of the United States.</p>

<h1 id="but-why">But <em>why</em>?</h1>
<p>The first death of a president that I can remember was Lyndon Johnson’s. In retrospect,
it seems odd that I wasn’t aware of Truman dying only a few weeks earlier, but I was young and
I did not regularly watch the news. When I saw the reports of Johnson’s funeral, I didn’t
know who he was. When I asked about it, I was told he had been the president before Nixon.
The idea that there could be a living ex-president intrigued me. I knew that Nixon was the current
president, and I knew about other presidents who were long dead, but it had never occurred to me that
there could be a living person who had been president. However, at the point in time when I came to that realization, there was no longer any living ex-president.</p>

<p>At the time, I wondered if it was unusual for there to be no living ex-president. As if in
answer to that question, the number of living ex-presidents steadily increased as I grew older, and
I started to wonder if there had ever been as many living ex-presidents.</p>

<p>I also remember being fascinated when I learned that John Quincy Adams served in congress
after being president. What other notable things did ex-presidents do?</p>

<p>I built this site in order to explore and answer my childhood questions about ex-presidents.
I now know that I experienced one of the few times in history when there were no living ex-presidents,
and I then watched that number grow to five, a number reached only once before, and never exceeded.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-an-expotus">What is an exPOTUS?</h1>
<p>An exPOTUS is a living ex-President of the United States. This site limits the definition
to <em>living</em> ex-presidents, because it is about the <em>lives</em> of ex-presidents. It follows,
then, that a president who dies while in office is never an exPOTUS. A president becomes
an exPOTUS upon leaving office, and ceases to be an exPOTUS upon death.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-if-an-expotus-becomes-president-again">What happens if an exPOTUS becomes president again?</h1>
<p>An exPOTUS who becomes president again ceases to be an exPOTUS while in office.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-if-two-expotuses-die-on-the-same-day">What happens if two exPOTUSes die on the same day?</h1>
<p>It complicates the data model and supporting logic.</p>
